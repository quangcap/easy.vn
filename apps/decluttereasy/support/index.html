      <h1>DeclutterEasy Support</h1>
      
      <p>Need help with DeclutterEasy? We're here to assist you in organizing your spaces and making the most of our decluttering tools.</p>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p><strong>How do I create my first decluttering project?</strong></p>
      <p>Simply open the app and tap "Create New Project". Choose a room type, give it a name, and start adding areas you'd like to organize.</p>

      <p><strong>Can I track multiple rooms at once?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes! DeclutterEasy supports unlimited room projects. You can work on your bedroom, kitchen, and living room simultaneously with separate progress tracking for each.</p>

      <h2>Using the Features</h2>
      <p><strong>How does progress tracking work?</strong></p>
      <p>Each room project shows your completion percentage based on the tasks you've marked as done. You can view daily, weekly, and monthly progress charts.</p>

      <p><strong>Can I add photos to my projects?</strong></p>
      <p>Absolutely! Take before and after photos to visualize your progress. All photos are stored locally on your device for privacy.</p>

      <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
      <p><strong>What's included in the premium subscription?</strong></p>
      <p>Premium features include advanced room templates, custom decluttering schedules, donation center finder, and detailed progress analytics.</p>

      <p><strong>How do I manage my subscription?</strong></p>
      <p>Subscriptions are managed through the App Store. Go to Settings > Apple ID > Subscriptions to modify or cancel.</p>

      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
      <p><strong>My data isn't syncing between devices</strong></p>
      <p>Currently, DeclutterEasy stores all data locally on your device. Cloud sync is planned for future updates.</p>

      <p><strong>The app is running slowly</strong></p>
